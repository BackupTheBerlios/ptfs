src/ptfs.c:
===========
 
Date: 2009-04-09.
Parser related code from Cocom project was removed.
New parser related code was derived from "cnog/check.c" of
the Aurochs distribution version 1.0.93.
The web site of the Aurochs project: http://aurochs.fr


Date: 2008-11-14.
This file was created using three sources by Stanislav Bobykin.

- Parser related code was derived from "AMMUNITION/earlyey.c" of 
  the Cocom distribution version 0.996. 
  The web site of the Cocom project: http://cocom.sourceforge.net

- FUSE related code was derived from 
  http://fuse.sourceforge.net/helloworld.html
  http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/fuse/index.php?title=Hello_World_%28fuse_opt.h%29
  The code form these examples was used as a template
  for realizing the FUSE subsystem in PTFS.
  Keywords for the FUSE related code:
	'struct options'
	'struct fuse_operations hello_oper'
  Macros 'HELLOFS_OPT_KEY' was reused and renamed to 'PTFS_OPT_KEY'.

- File reading (mmap) code was derived from 
  http://beej.us/guide/bgipc/output/html/multipage/mmap.html


Date: 2009-06-10.
Parser related code was moved to 'src/parse.c'

Date: 2009-06-17.
The code related with FUSE operations was moved to 'src/fuse_ops.c'.


src/parse.c:
============

Date: 2009-06-10.

This file contains the code for parsing, that was moved from 'src/ptfs.c'.
The code that uses Aurochs parsing API was reused 
from 'cnog/check.c' of the Aurochs distribution version 1.0.93.
The web site of the Aurochs project: http://aurochs.fr

src/fuse_ops.c:
===============

Date: 2009-06-17.
The file contains code for FUSE operations, it was moved from from 'src/ptfs.c'.
The code initially was created using examples from
  http://fuse.sourceforge.net/helloworld.html
  http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/fuse/index.php?title=Hello_World_%28fuse_opt.h%29
as a template.
Struct 'hello_oper' was renamed to 'ptfs_ops'


src/Makefile.am:
================

Date: 2009-06-15.
The target .c.o was written using the analogous target from automatically 
generated 'src/Makefile' (Automake verion 1.10.2 was used).

Rewritten '.c.o':
=====
.c.o:
	$(CPP) -M -MF $(DEPDIR)/$*.Tpo $(DEPS_CFLAGS) -I../aurochs/include/  $<
	$(OCAMLC) $(OCAMLC_CCOPT) $(DEPS_OCAMLC_CCOPT) $<
	mv -f $(DEPDIR)/$*.Tpo $(DEPDIR)/$*.Po
=====

Original '.c.o':
=====
.c.o:
        $(COMPILE) -MT $@ -MD -MP -MF $(DEPDIR)/$*.Tpo -c -o $@ $<
        mv -f $(DEPDIR)/$*.Tpo $(DEPDIR)/$*.Po
=====
To see the original target (in 'src/Makefile') 
comment out rewritten (in 'src/Makefile.am).
Note: tested using automake version 1.10.2.
