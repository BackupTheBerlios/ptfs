PTFS - is a file system allowing to navigate through parse tree. 
Essential parameters for mounting is a file with some text and a grammar
(describing the structure of input text).

Note: currently, PTFS is at the early stage of development so
      it is very unstable.

To build, run:
	cmake .
	make

To install, run:
	make install

Usage example (mounting new parse tree):
	ptfs -g examples/grammar -i examples/text  mountpoint
For umount use:
	fusermount -u mointpoint
