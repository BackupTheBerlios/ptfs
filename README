PTFS - is a file system allowing to navigate through parse tree. 
Essential parameters for mounting are a file with some text and a grammar
(describing the structure of input text).

The goal of the project is to create hacker friendly environment for writing
source code mining and transformation utilities.

Note: currently, PTFS is at the early stage of development so
      it is very unstable and not feature complete.


INSTALLATION
============
To build, run:
	$ cmake .
	$ make

To install, run:
	$ make install


USAGE EXAMPLE
=============
To mount new parse tree type:

To see the subtext related with a node (directory) in a parse tree 
use something like:
